As far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, the conditions of life appear to act in two waysâ€”directly on the while organization or on certain parts alone and indirectly by affecting the reproduce system. Wit respect to the direct action, we must be in mid that in every case, as Professor Weismann has lastly insisted, and as I have indigently shown in my work on "Variation under Domestication," there area two factors: namely, the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions. The former sems to be much the more important; for Nealy similar variations sometimes airs under, as far as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and, on the otter hand, dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be nearly uniform. The effects on the offspring are either definite or in definite. They may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the offspring off individuals exposed to certain conditions during several generations are modified in the same manner.
