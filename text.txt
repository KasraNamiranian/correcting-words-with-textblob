As far as I am abl to judg, after long attnding to the sbject, the condiions of lfe apear to act in two ways—directly on the whle organsaton or on certin parts alne and indirectly by afcting the reproducte sstem. Wit respct to te dirct action, we mst bea in mid tht in every cse, as Profesor Weismann hs latly insistd, and as I have inidently shwn in my wrk on "Variatin undr Domesticcation," thcere arae two factrs: namly, the natre of the orgnism and the natture of the condiions. The frmer sems to be much th mre importannt; foor nealy siimilar variations sometimes aris under, as far as we cn juddge, disimilar conditios; annd, on te oter hannd, disssimilar variatioons arise undder conditions which aappear to be nnearly uniiform. The efffects on tthe offspring arre ieither definnite or in definite. They maay be considdered as definnite whhen allc or neearly all thhe ofefspring off inadividuals exnposed tco ceertain conditionas duriing seveal ggenerations aree moodified in te saame maner.
